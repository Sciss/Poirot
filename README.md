# Poirot

## statement

Poirot is a Scala front-end for the [JaCoP](https://github.com/Sciss/jacop) constraints solver library. It was
originally based on the Scala DSL included with JaCoP, written and (C)opyright by Krzysztof Kuchcinski and
Radoslaw Szymanek. All modifications and new interface (C)opyright 2013 by Hanns Holger Rutz. All rights reserved.

Poirot is released under the [GNU Affero General Public License](http://github.com/Sciss/Poirot/blob/master/LICENSE)

## linking

To use this project as a library, use the following artifact:

    "de.sciss" %% "poirot" % v

The current version `v` is `0.1.+`

## building

This project currently builds with sbt 0.13 against Scala 2.10. It requires the JaCoP 3.3.0 artifact published under
the `de.sciss` group ID. It should be automatically retrieved from Maven Central.

To compile, use `sbt compile`, for the API docs `sbt doc`, to jump into a REPL `sbt console`.

## differences to the original Scala DSL

- You must use an implicit instance of `Model`
- Operators follow standard Scala naming, e.g. `|`, `&`, `^` instead of `\/`, `/\`, `xor` for boolean combinators
- Standard Scala style, e.g. argument names, camel case etc.; more consistent use of empty parens
- Removing unnecessary things such as `ClassTag`s
- Removing global state when possible

##Â getting started
                            ^
You need evidence of a `Model` instance for most operations. Constraints are automatically posted to that model.
Examples are provided in the test directory, you can selectively run them via `sbt test:run`.
